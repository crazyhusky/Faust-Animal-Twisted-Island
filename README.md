# Faust-Animal-Twisted-Island read me

Hi there, This file is for basic information about the game.

Story
-
You have been taken against your will to an island by Faust. A giant Malamute with expertise in transformative sciences and magic.
The island that you are on, is one that Faust has been using as experiemental test area.
As a result nearly all the people the have been mutated and twisted into animal like people, a lot of have lost their
minds and have become primal or feral. This has caused the island to be isolated and have no forms of communiation to the
outside world.

Faust is using you as a guinea pig to test, how well a human will survive in the environment he has created.
Your job is to escape the island and to return back home to tell people of the island.

Gameplay
-
This is a text based RPG, 
There are a lot of adult themed content within this game, so if you are easily offended then DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.
As I am a huge fan of transformation themed content this game has a lot of it.
Many items within the this game will transform your body parts or make new ones grow. 
Certain body parts give you new combat skills to use battle.
